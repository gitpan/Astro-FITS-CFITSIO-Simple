	  call in scalar context when reading multiple columns was broken

	* lib/Astro/FITS/CFITSIO/Simple.pod: after bug fix for bit field
	  chunk reset bogosity, speed has improved tremendously, so no need
	  to warn about slowness.

2005-05-11 15:33  dj

	* lib/Astro/FITS/CFITSIO/Simple/Table.pm: when processing bit
	  fields as bits (not logicals), the ENTIRE destination piddle was
	  set to zero, not just the destination for the current chunk.
	  this resulted not only in bogus data, but also slowed things down
	  TREMENDOUSLY.

	  it wasn't caught by the tests because the data all fit inside of
	  a single chunk.  they've been tweaked to set the chunk size to 1
	  so as to trigger bugs like these.

2005-05-11 15:21  dj

	* t/: ret.t, rfilter.t, table_dtypes.t: forced ninc to 1 to reveal
	  errors in processing multiple chunks

2005-05-11 15:15  dj

	* t/binbits.t: force one row per chunk in order to expose errors
	  which weren't caught because all of the data fit in one chunk.

	* lib/Astro/FITS/CFITSIO/Simple/Table.pm: added support for
	  subtractive column name specification

	  major reorganization to handle bit columns. one big change is
	  that data transfer between buffers is now done via on the fly
	  created subroutines.

	* lib/Astro/FITS/CFITSIO/Simple/PDL.pm: "supports" TULONG and
	  TUINT.  not really. it just points them at long(), which is
	  wrong.  But, PDL has no uint or ulong types.
