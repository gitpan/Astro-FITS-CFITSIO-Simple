Astro-FITS-CFITSIO-Simple version 0.13
======================================

This module presents an uncomplicated interface to reading (and
eventually writing) FITS files with the CFITSIO library.  It attempts
to perform the intuitive action when left to its own devices, but much
of its behavior can be controlled by an application.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Params::Validate
  Astro::FITS::Header
  Astro::FITS::Header::CFITSIO
  Astro::FITS::CFITSIO
  Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::CheckStatus

This module was developed against version 2.8.1 of
Astro::FITS::Header, which has bugs in it which must be patched in
order for Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::Simple to operate.  Patches which fix
the problems on the following web sites.

        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=4816
        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11722

Asgtro::FITS::Header version 3.000 does not suffer from these bugs, and
does not require the patches.
